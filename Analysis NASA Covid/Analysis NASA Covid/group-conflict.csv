We had our first heated discussion, yesterday. It was over lunch and he flew off very emphati‐cally that irresponsible scientists [were] trying to find favor with politicians—I am not sure if we were getting towards oil and global warming, but he went on for about 5 minutes, got inter‐rupted by an activity he had to do, and came back to say he realized he had been very adamant, but he felt it was all a big problem with scientists pushing theories as fact to a gullible populace, and worse, scheming politicians. I just listened and let it all calm down. I cannot afford to have arguments of any type with [my crewmate].
I was really surprised this morning to find that X had completely failed to perform a task yester‐day, one required in order for me to perform a task this morning. I was quite angry and later apologized and accepted responsibility for not “monitoring” more closely. I’m still disappointed that X never took responsibility for the mistake.
Had a 5 minute break. Went to grab some coffee. Y has now decided not to have the water heater on continuously, so had no hot water. Again amazed by how inconsiderate Y is.
We did have a run‐in one night. I was really livid after Z snapped at me quite viciously about something that wasn’t my fault. I let Z have it, like I can’t remember ever before in a professional relationship, and stormed off.
We moved some racks together today, in the morning and throughout that entire process U was barking at me constantly.
I’m finding myself losing tolerance for T. I can’t explain exactly what it is that bothers me.
I feel like I am complaining in these journals, and maybe that is what they are for. But regardless, I am lucky I have this opportunity and it will be gone before I know it, so I am enjoying it to the maximum I can—even with the ____ I have to stay here with.
