The ground seems to treat almost every request we make a little defensively, as if a crew request implies irritation or dissatisfaction. I will need to work on that.
X rubbed me the wrong way again. In general, he sounds patronizing and condescending on the radio, and always must have the last word. When I ask a question, he has a tendency to talk down to me as if I don’t know what I’m doing.
Interesting, how you can be on top of the world one moment (literally) and then be completely demoralized the next, because of what is said on the ground.
I feel that the ground has often made my life more difficult here, thus making it hard to hand out praise on such a frequent basis. I have developed a list of folks who have gone above and beyond the call, and I plan to reward them when I return to Earth. But I feel that the praise the shuttle crews hand out is a bit overdone. If they are expecting to be praised over and over and then someone challenges their work and focus, it may be why the relationship is strained.
As the time goes on, my natural inhibition against lashing out on the radio about something that isn’t going right for various reasons is noticeably reduced. I need to be careful, because I know very well that I can undo a good reputation with a single misplaced or inappropriate sentence. As it is, I sort of lashed out last week about a few things. I don’t think I said anything so inappro‐priate, but my tone of voice and manner were not as polite as usual.
I really enjoy working with Huntsville. Nice folks and they are always enthusiastic and interested.
Today, “Scottie” as we call him, organized a tribute for me—a wonderful gesture that caught me by surprise and truly made me smile. He is full of spirit and a sense of humor. I look forward to seeing him in Huntsville after the mission.
W carries on his twice‐daily arguments with his mission control center as usual, but I’ve learned that what appears to an American to be a dispute is actually just their normal mode of conversa‐tion. To me it’s interesting to hear the difference in the US and Russian interactions. US radio conversation is minimal—sometimes we go all day without saying a word to Houston. The Russians, however, have marathon discussions on nearly every subject that comes up.
