We looked at it, cleared it—and presto, we have a decent table now that does not knock you while running on TVIS, and its built‐in fan and heaters work! He said, “Why did you not mention this earlier?!” We are pleased and will carefully store the pieces in the FGB, behind a panel.
There’s only room for two at the table, so three of us just float and juggle our food. I’m not sure what the idea is for when we have six of us up here.
After a week here, I notice the noise on the ISS. It is markedly louder in the SM, where I wear ear plugs all the time. In the USOS, it is quieter, but still loud near the aft end of the lab. Fortunately, inside the TESS is very quiet. In the USOS, I generally wear ear plugs too, but I do give my ears stretches without. Wearing ear plugs constantly irritates the ears, so some breaks are necessary.
I will mention a relatively minor thing that is starting to become an irritant. That is the high‐pitched loud noise that comes from the ___ rack. I’m pretty sure it is the ___ pump and it is way too loud. One of the environmental things I miss the most is quiet—complete silence. Unfortu‐nately my primary work place is right in front of it because of its proximity to the ___ panel and the laptop I use most.
We had a tag‐up today to discuss options. There aren’t many. None of the other gloves onboard is a better fit. The EVA may be at risk.
During the day, the Service Module feels like a steam bath. Usually there are 4 or more people in there, and the systems are just not keeping up to maintain temperature, humidity, and CO2 under control. As I fly through the Station and enter the SM, it feels like running into a blanket of muggy stale air. I am very glad that my work is generally elsewhere.
We heard the usual clicks over the loudspeakers, a byproduct of the relays operating, and X floated nearby, and then said, “Over here—it is the smell again.” It was like you had your face in a can of paint. This is very dangerous, so I said we should turn it off and close the valves now. X seemed uncertain, and I said we can’t let it go on. He reported the smell as coming from __ just before we lost comm with Moscow. They came right back and said shut it down; I was relieved.
Physically, I am exhausted. My arms and hands are somewhat beat up and worn out. The suit could have fit better.
So, at the moment we have no systems working to purify and circulate our air, control tempera‐ture, or generate oxygen. This all comes after a separator pump failure last night that knocked out our toilet. We do have spares onboard and hope that replacing the separator will solve the problem. In the meantime, we are using the Soyuz facility, which has very little capacity. When it rains it pours. Until today, Survival Mode was just the name of a mode of the Command and Con‐trol Computers, which I had to understand theoretically. It’s taken on a more substantial mean‐ing for me today.
M was tired even before we started. His cooling failed twice, causing him to egress the suit and troubleshoot connections, etc. Problem was a chronic bend in a water tube, one that M thought should have been fixed long ago after the problem plagued someone else. That added being frustrated to being tired, and put us over an hour behind before we ever opened the hatch.
The biggest news here was a meltdown of the file server yesterday. The biggest impact has been a loss of email for a day. It happened just after I composed and launched a bunch of emails.
So many laptops have failed that we now have to scavenge. Psychologically, this is significant because I am now effectively computerless in the SM, so spend my browsing time in the Lab away from X. It feels strange—only meals and the toilet lead me to the SM now.
We almost had another “upset” for the weekend when our OCA Router died today. Fortunately we recovered with a reboot. I believe the parts are overheating and need to be replaced.
The only irritant I continue to work through is the TVIS and the discomfort with the harness while running. Being a lover of running it is very frustrating. I also worry that it might cause long‐term damage to my hips.
Latest pet peeve: I don’t think we can get to the Moon and Mars on disposable batteries.
The connectors are gamma type, which translates into being a royal pain in the ass. T said the only reason that you need to timeline two folks to do this is so that one person can swear full‐time. At one point, we thought we might need to get Y, so that we could have 2 people swearing!
