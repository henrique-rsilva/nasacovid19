Getting email certainly is appreciated.
The crew dynamic on board is excellent.
Slept great last night. Makes all the difference.
The change of command was awesome.
I rang them onboard with the ship’s bell.
Our 100‐day party was yesterday, and V and I phoned in to the bar and chatted with all the folks there. It sounded like everyone was enjoying the party. I received an email this morning showing scenes from the party. They had set up life‐sized cardboard cutouts of W and me and the pictures showed us surrounded by adoring women. Very nice!
Last night, I remembered to write the poem US Navy tradition seems to expect of commanders on ships, at New Year. It delayed me going to bed an hour, which did not improve my attitude to the tradition, but I feel great now that it is behind me!
