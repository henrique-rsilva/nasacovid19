I am a little apprehensive about this EVA. It will, in all likelihood, be my last one. I would like for it to be successful, of course. Not only for the good of the program, but also for professional and personal satisfaction. If all goes well it will be unremarkable to folks on the ground (which is good, the best result that one can hope for!). However, if we have problems, we will be remembered poorly, since it is human nature to remember the latest events.
I am ready, but a bit nervous. Lots of connections have to go right tomorrow—and be on time. We have several “bingo” points where we might have to back out if we are not far enough along. Hopefully, it won’t come to that.
My last few days aboard have been busy, but not particularly fulfilling. The end brought the typical (at least for me) rush of activity, most of which could easily have been done earlier in the increment. I had months to do certain things and did most of them in the last seven days.
