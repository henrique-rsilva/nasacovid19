When we finally got the hatch open, things started flying out like you see in the movies. We had positioned some wet and dry napkins (in small packages that were in turn in two different draw‐string bags) in the DC in the event we had to clean up. When we went to vacuum, the individual bags became bloated, and all would no longer fit in the drawstring bags. This resulted in them being jettisoned from said bag. At that point they were floating free inside the DC until the hatch was opened. Then they all seemed to be sucked out into space by some invisible wind. They were accompanied by at least three rather large bolts.
I had to wait to get started, so began working on something else instead that ran into problems. Before I knew it I had 3 different partially complete things going on, which is normally fine, but the number of bags and hoses and cables and wires and boxes that were all in my way–well, I guess it got me a bit frustrated. Starting off already behind on an ambitious day is a recipe for a huge amount of stress. I sort of became aware of how stressed I was when I raced down to take a picture at the specified time. The weather was perfect, but I couldn’t find the darn [target]. Eventually I did, but then I had 5 seconds to get it into the frame of the lens, and at 800mm, I tried over and over to find it, line it up, find it, line it up, find it, and failed. I slammed one of the panels with my fist in frustration and yelled something I wouldn’t want on tape. This happened in front of my crew‐mates and I was immediately aware that it was a display they hadn’t seen from me before. It shocked me back into a reality check, and the rest of the day I tried to actively cool myself off.
