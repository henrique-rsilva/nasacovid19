I feel a little lost today.
Last week was difficult and long. Probably seemed like it, because of the food situation.
I’m sure this is a natural cycle of moods and hopefully won’t last very long.
ISS crewmembers and shuttle crew are not treated equally.
Too bad that ISS crews don’t get the publicity that the shuttle crews seem to get!
Starting to feel like this is a little “routine.”
Stuff on the ground is also affecting my mood.
I hesitate to use the word “depression,” but it seems an appropriate description of my mood lately. Nothing seems to cheer me up much.
Perhaps this is the 3rd quarter “blues” setting in. I always figured that it would be the hardest period of the expedition. Perhaps the Shuttle crew’s return to Earth (leaving us here) has also contributed to it. I am tired of being here but have to continue to work it out so as to maintain a steady course.
Just feeling downright grumpy today. At lunch I was throwing food away because I was frustrated with how it is packed and organized. Later I was complaining about how the water sampling pro‐cedures were organized.
I can’t believe that other astronauts have not been just as frustrated as I am. Maybe they just don’t say anything.
Was in a bit of a bad mood yesterday (Sunday); perhaps a reaction to the ____ cancellation.
As the end of the mission approaches, I will no doubt start to think of all of the things I could have and should have done. One of them is to have chronicled things better–both my thoughts and emotions, and the day‐to‐day things that went on.
The comments he shared with me from the ground really hurt me. I have still not recovered and am not myself. I had been having quite a bit of fun up here, but the last few days have been far from fun.
I’ve been feeling slightly depressed lately, which I sort of measure by my inability to get going on a number of personal projects that I really need to make headway on. Today would have been a good opportunity. I had some free time. But I just couldn’t force myself to work on anything (beyond what I was required to do for my job).
With time on my hands for half an hour, I feel slightly melancholy, for some reason. This happens quite often in space, among astronauts in general (and cosmonauts), and space seems to some‐how amplify our emotions, positive or negative, however they might be. Maybe it is the remote‐ness, or the beautiful scene outside, or a consciousness that we are in a unique situation, bene‐fiting from the work of others. News stories have powerful emotional impacts on me.
