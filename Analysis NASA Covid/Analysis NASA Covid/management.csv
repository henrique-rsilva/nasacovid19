This is actually a source of some frustration for station crews–they train us for years, but when the shuttle crew comes up they do most of the operational work.
I still get frustrated by the degree to which we get left out of the loop. This has been a perpetual problem in the ISS crew world.
Contrary to the briefing last night, the ground wanted to begin arm motion earlier than scheduled, prior to my availability. This certainly did nothing to give me confidence in the ground team and reinforces my belief that the ground too often fails to consider the crew when making decisions and taking action.
Something that Houston has continued to do that is a little irritating, is cancel events for me because of a perception that I am too busy. Yes, I do have a full work schedule, but Houston is canceling fun events, like talking to celebrities and doing interviews. I sent our folks a polite note asking them to let me do these things. I am not too busy.
Although there are a lot of seemingly little things (it’s hard to gauge how big they are, being too close to it all) that are bothering me about NASA, I must not let it get to me.
I continue to be amazed by the degree to which the ground has gotten into the habit of taking action and not informing the crew.
It’s difficult to put up with what I see as tasks that waste my time, while other things that I want to do fall off as lower priority. I am in a difficult position, in that if I want to discuss these issues with the ground, I may be perceived as grumpy or complaining.
The expectation is that I’ll just do the right thing, regardless. I would expect at least some inter‐est in identifying obsolescence with an eye toward correcting it in the future. It doesn’t happen.
I learned today during the weekly planning conference that my schedule is so packed that they had to schedule 3.5 hours of work for me on one of my upcoming days off. This is a bit irritating. I wasted so much time this week and to now take it out of my scheduled time off is going a bit far.
I get the feeling the US and Russian teams are a little stressed with each other. An incredibly unnecessary and pedantic US procedure to ___ should have no consequence to the Russian side, but my whole morning activity carrying out this procedure was cancelled, because it involved X helping me read a meter for 5 minutes, so opening the door to have the Russians review and probably ridicule the US procedure. Houston simply told me when I pressed them that the Rus‐sians had not blessed the procedure, and I jumped to these conclusions. It is probably a reaction by the Russians to Houston nagging Moscow about the upcoming ___, making them take a bit of their own medicine. I am not sure what X and I can do to ease all this. At least we can work together calmly and make that evident to Moscow and Houston.
The teleconference was very interrogative and left me a little ticked off. I did not even bring it up with S until the next day, because I knew it would make him angry at the US side and I did not want to spoil his good mood on the eve of the weekend.
I like the incremental approach the Russians use for preparing for this sort of event; the Ameri‐cans would assume that you’ll do all your mental preparation in your spare time.
I was a bit upset today as I reviewed plans for the week and EVA prep. Turns out there are no PAO events after our EVA. I find this unacceptable and voiced my opinion. The response was that there are too many high priority items to be taken care of. I want the US taxpayers to know what we are doing up here and it only takes about 30 minutes of our time to do an event. I offered my weekends and personal time if that would help them out. We shall see.
The problem at NASA is that nobody can or will stand up to the safety organization. The safety folks seem to concentrate on minutia while neglecting big things. We need managers to override the safety organization or we will never get to Mars. The journey itself will be deemed to be too unsafe. Can you imagine Koroliev or Von Braun succeeding in this environment?
The week finished on a high note, I had our regular Astronaut office and Flight director’s confer‐ences yesterday, as well as the Program manager’s conference today. In all three, we discussed my concerns about inefficient use of time onboard and the consequences to doing meaningful science and other work. All were very receptive, so I was satisfied with the meetings. I am sure that I am not the first crewmember to voice such sentiments. Time will tell whether or not things change. There’s a lot of inertia at a large organization like NASA.
