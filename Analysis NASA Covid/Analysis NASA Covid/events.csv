Well, we’re finally here. The launch met all my expectations. Damned small vehicle.
The Space Station is no longer a peaceful and quite place anymore. There are busy people every‐where and in all directions. It was an amazing sight to see the Shuttle pull into view below the Station. It wasn’t at all like watching a Soyuz or Progress. The Shuttle is a gorgeous and huge spaceship by comparison, and so much more capable. It brought tears to my eyes, and I couldn’t help but think of it as my ride home at that moment.
Another tumultuous day. We said goodbye to our crewmates and I was sad to see them go.
It is difficult having the place raided and in such an upheaval. It will take the rest of the expedi‐tion to regain order I’m sure.
The Soyuz approach was absolutely amazing. They approach the near phase hot with jets blasting away to slow the craft and capture the station‐keeping target prior to the fly around.
It felt like a scene from 2001! The Soyuz seats three abreast. The commander sits in the center seat; I’m in the left seat with a duplicate computer display, entry keypad, a set of unique direct command keys, but no flight controls.
This attitude really screws up Ku coverage. I really hate it.
I have been “on top of the world” since watching the Soyuz launch this morning and knowing that relief is on the way. We also are enjoying watching the Shuttle trail behind us. What a great docked mission that was.
We are beginning to ramp up with the EVA preparations. I am looking forward to this one more than the last, because I feel more in control with what we are doing.
Today is EVA day. I’m starting to have that I‐think‐I‐must‐be‐forgetting‐something feeling. MCC‐M just called to disallow me from using the ___. It’s too close to the EVA to let myself get upset, but I can tell that I will be. It’s all about “not invented here.”
We heard a big bump in the morning yesterday that we think could have been a meteor strike.
Lots of radiation flashes bothered me last night.
Today is the third day of unexpected solar flare activity. We had to take shelter in designated areas inside of ISS.
I always knew that this could happen [another solar flare] and it is a little disconcerting. How‐ever, there is nothing we can do about it. If we had been on a mission to the Moon or Mars, we would have taken the full brunt of the radiation. That is a problem for which we don’t have a good solution as of yet.
All is well on board, at least now it is. We had a fire—or at least smoke—out of the ___ that caused a little commotion for a couple of hours. It was brought under control right away, we never had to don masks and the filtering of the atmosphere was completed quickly.
My 100‐day party is coming up this week. That will be an interesting and fun event. I’m not sure how it will be to interact with a big group from here, but I’m psyched we’re having a party.
Happy New Year! We’ve really enjoyed our time off.
New Year’s Eve is over, I must say with some relief. I was aware that it was as important for X’s family as Christmas was for mine, so I suggested activities. He invited me to join his family video conference, and I politely waved and joked for 15 minutes or so and then discretely left.
I am not sure I look forward to Holidays on ISS, especially those that are not followed by a week‐end. The effort is made to be happy and people on the ground go out of their way to help each other and us, but the effect is to fill the Holiday with a lot of friendly social stuff, chatter on the air to ground, some expectancy for a little show from the crew, VIP telephones calls etc. Mean‐while the things you really count on, like email updates, swift responses to your questions about work matters etc. degrade, because the ground teams have gone to [partial staffing]. Unlike on Earth where this would be enjoyable, because you do not have to work, here it is spoiled because there are always high priority work tasks that just cannot wait until the next day. I can clearly see from my whining here that time pressure is the biggest factor affecting my mood.
