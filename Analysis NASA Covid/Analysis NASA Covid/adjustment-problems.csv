This place is really an emotional rollercoaster for me.
There is so much going on that I feel overwhelmed. I am worried that I don’t remember as much of my training as I should. I am looking forward to the pace slowing a bit, so that I can settle in.
One of the problems is that our training doesn’t really cover some of the basics of life in orbit that we need to have under control. We spend all of our time on emergency scenarios and spacewalks. Sometimes understanding how to live would go a long way to increasing the success of the mission.
I think this would be frustrating regardless of where I was, but I definitely need to let go of this and forget about it.
I believe I have learned that I do not have what it takes to be a long duration crewmember. I have accomplished much up here, and I am proud of that, but I don’t believe my future is in long duration.
