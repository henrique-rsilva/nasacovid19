One of the really neat things about this whole adventure is that by the time you’re doing it, everyone you’re doing it with is a long‐time friend. This even holds true for the folks on the ground. Every voice I’ve heard on the radio so far has been someone who I know.
Thank goodness we have the IP phone and Email to keep in touch with our loved ones.
Happy it is the holiday and we get to drive our own schedule. That feels a little like we have some control over our lives. I think that is why it feels good.
Weekends have come to mean two things: a break from the schedule enslavement and the tick‐ing of a countdown for return home. Initially they marked a count up but now seem to be transi‐tioning to be more of a countdown.
I have regained my sense of humor and shrugged off the tedium. The Capcom has done a good job of disarming my potential for getting frustrated.
Suddenly I’m really appreciating the solitude that I have here. It does help to have control of your own environment if you’re going to be isolated. I’m trying to picture what it would be like up here with a crew of 6. It would be totally, completely, absolutely different. It would be more fun at times, and there would be more camaraderie. That would be positive. But, the entire US seg‐ment is the equivalent of my house right now and sharing it would be huge difference. We are very lucky to be here a time when the Station is so huge, yet there are only 3 of us to share it. This is quite a luxury!
Today, I am glad we have normal work to do. The time goes by better and I feel more cheerful, with the little ups and downs of getting the day’s plan accomplished.
It was a well‐timed event personally, because it brought me out of a state of “blues” that had been hanging over me all day. I woke up this morning thinking, “OK I don’t want to ‘play’ any‐more. I just want to be home sleeping in our bed, eating at the dining table, sitting in my recliner.”
Some words that have helped came from my friend ___, who flew last year. He said “At this par‐ticular time, you just have to start letting go. It’s time to move on, and you can’t hold onto the role that you had, so don’t even try. Instead take comfort in knowing that you did a good job and that it’s time to come home.”
I blew off some steam by sending Emails to some close confidants. I suppose this will be a good test to see if they are reading every note.
I realize that often times I use this journal to vent my frustrations. This helps me collect my composure to deal with the situations. I must continue to look at the big picture and count myself lucky to be here.
I think it is good to write this down—typing gets out some of these frustrations.
Writing in this journal helps to let off steam!
