Sunday is meant to be a day of rest, but somehow Houston managed to make it feel like Monday. The problem is that I overreached myself a couple of weeks ago, feeling I was really helping out the ground to understand the problem with the ____.
The lack of “padding” in the schedule means that there is little time to accomplish small tasks, or to recover from mistakes.
Today was a hard day. Small things are getting to me. I am tired. I think that the ground is scheduling less time for tasks than before. So, there is very little, if any fat left in the schedule for me to use to catch up on little things during the day.
Only 30 minutes [were scheduled] to execute a 55‐step procedure that required collecting 21 items. It took 3 or 4 hours.
Skipped breakfast and finally made up the work and time. Otherwise it would have been a fairly nice pace today.
Several of the procedures, as usual, just took much longer than timelined. We have some tasks, as is too often the case, that were written without our input and which we never actually performed, except on paper.
[The Russians] save the really low‐skill work for me—changing filters, cleaning fan grills, etc. I don’t mind—they schedule plenty of time, so I’m not rushed, and it’s somewhat relaxing.
