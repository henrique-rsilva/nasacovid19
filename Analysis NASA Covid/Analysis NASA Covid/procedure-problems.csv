I found a few procedure problems already. I don’t have much tolerance for that, and some pro‐cedures are written so poorly.
I don’t like it when they uplink procedures with errors. I sometimes wonder what they do all day. They clearly aren’t in the procedures along with the crew.
The ground team was working very hard to get the various updates incorporated into the proce‐dures and training products on board for our use.
Uplink consisted primarily of the ground procedures, containing steps and commands that have no significance to me as a crewmember. Accompanying this esoteric procedure were pages of tiny images that, with no context, are useless.
The radiogram was pretty simple: remove the ___, disconnect the power cable, replace with a ___ and the new ___, connect the cable. Done. However, there was so much involved that wasn’t taken into account in the procedure. I had to cut the cable out of a huge bundle of cables, the cable had a grounding wire of its own, the tool callouts weren’t even close to that required, the bolts were installed backwards on one of the new ___, there was a bolt missing from another, the terminator on the grounding wire on the new cable was too small for the bolt that attaches it to go through, and more. It was overwhelmingly obvious that no one had looked at the procedure on any kind of flight‐like mockup. It took me the three hours to install just one.
We discussed options and looked at the 5 word description of the task (a couple of times) and decided I needed to remove the ___ and clean under there. After chasing down the right tools, I took one ___ off and it was also clean. I think I know why there is a cosmonaut union now!
