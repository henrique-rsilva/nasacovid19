Had an uneventful rendezvous and docking, but then had to work quite a few hours that day in order to unpack the Soyuz and ready it for an emergency landing if necessary. I found myself getting pretty inefficient; by the time I go to bed tonight my work day will have been about 27 hours, and that’s on top of 2 nights with pretty minimal sleep. I don’t know what could be done about it, but I think they should give us time off after docking.
One thing is for sure—I’m ready for the weekend. The past couple of days of reduced sleep and eating opportunities have added a little strain. I felt it especially yesterday. Today, the fatigue and hunger are present but not the strain.
The fatigue was evident when a couple of minor mistakes were made today on some payload activities. The ground caught the mistake and helped me out. But it is an obvious indicator of fatigue.
I haven’t been saying much about our long workdays, but we’re getting a lot done too. There have been many PR events as well—probably an average of once per day.
That made for about an 18‐hour working day. Our working day started at midnight, by the way, just to make sure we were extra tired.
I feel that the workload is going up; these last few weeks seem to have been pretty taxing. I’m very tired.
It was meant to be a day off, but Houston added payload activities, etc, so the day ended up being very busy.
It seems like I spent all day today working as fast as I could only to keep falling behind.
