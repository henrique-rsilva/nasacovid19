It’s late and I’m tired, but I want to get into some sort of routine doing this.
I am trying to get to bed to buy back some of the sleep deficit I’m building up.
I just need sleep.
I fell asleep while typing.
I feel pretty tired today. The fatigue is the result of getting only 6 hours of sleep most nights. The temptation to try to get a jump on tomorrow has been too great to ignore.
I was awakened in the middle of the night by the ground telling me to close the shutter on the lab window. It is beyond me why it couldn’t wait until wake up time.
Very tired. Woke up at 2 am and couldn’t get back to sleep. Finally fell asleep and overslept.
Half a day off today…I slept a solid NINE hours. I didn’t know I could sleep that long!
The morning started disastrously. I slept through two alarms, one set for 0600 and another a half‐hour later to remind me to take some CEO pictures. My body apparently went on strike for better working conditions.
I slept poorly again last night.
I again woke up earlier than I wanted, not feeling quite rested but afraid to squander any time.
The time shift is starting to make the end of the day tough. We are pretty tired right now having shifted about 6 hours over the weekend.
We started sleep shifting back to the left about 8.5 hours. I chose not to take any Ambien because although we were scheduled to go to bed early, I was pretty tired and figured I wouldn’t need it to fall asleep. I was correct, but failed to anticipate that I’d wake up a few hours into the sleep period and not be able to fall back asleep. I stayed awake for a couple of hours and was feeling rather anxious—not sure what about.
Since I haven’t been sleeping well I decided to preemptively move my sleeping bag elsewhere where it might be cooler. I chose my familiar home of the airlock, but slept poorly there anyway.
I need to get more sleep tonight than the past few. I can feel the fatigue accumulating and it will be important to be rested for the undocking in a few days. For that reason I will close for now.
