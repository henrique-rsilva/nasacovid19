We need to figure out how to do better on inspections and maintenance. We spend a huge amount of time doing inspections and routine maintenance on several small items that should be designed to not require so much.
I had to laugh to myself at the procedures today. To replace a light bulb, I had to have safety glasses and a vacuum cleaner handy. This was in case the bulb broke. However, the actual bulb is encased in a plastic enclosure, so even if the glass bulb did break, the shards would be completely contained. Also, I had to take a photo of the installed bulb, before turning it on. Why? I have no idea! It’s just the way NASA does things.
There have been no problems, yet we must periodically perform extensive inspections even though the results are always negative.
Busy work also causes me to miss home more. I think I feel less of a sense of purpose if I don’t believe in the tasks that I am doing. Of course, I will continue to do them and to press on. But, it does make the days go longer.
A lot of our work right now involves inventory and stowage in prep for the launch…Not very gla‐morous work, but necessary. Scientific work is pretty limited.
It was a frustrating day. The urine collection started disastrously first thing this morning. I think I got about 75% in the bag; the rest was all over me. Not a good way to start the day.
I started the consumables audit—too tedious for words. I become more convinced every day that we sacrifice crew efficiency and time on orbit to make things easier/cheaper for the ground. Instead of tracking consumables, we periodically require the crew to open up a myriad of bags, take everything out, count everything, and then put it back. We ought to keep a running count.
Yesterday was painful–trash gathering. Theoretically, this should not hurt, but when they want the trash items listed off by serial number it can get a bit ridiculous.
I was not able to finish many of the tasks in the time allotted. The frustration is that so much more meaningful work could be done.
It has been a pretty tedious week with tasks that were clearly allotted too little time on the schedule. Talking to [the MCC] today, I realized he just doesn’t understand how we work up here.
I have concluded that I hate to perform maintenance. Science is okay; installations are okay; maintenance sucks. The tools are inadequate and the equipment is not designed to be opera‐tionally compatible or “user friendly.”
One of the reasons it gets tiring up here, I realize, is that many of the tasks we have to do are frustrating. This has to do with the way the Station was designed, how we use it differently than intended perhaps, and how the owners of each system and piece of equipment want us to do the work. The 4 hours of work to set up and take down the medical equipment is an example.
